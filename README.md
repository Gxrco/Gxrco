**Junior Developer (Backend Dev/Database Administrator/ Cloud Computing Learner)**

I describe myself as a person who is enthusiastic about all new technologies, especially with connectivity and platforms that work in parallel. This has led me to have a preference for backend development, but that does not detract from my willingness to learn as if I were a full-stack developer. Right now I am studying Computer Science at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, career which drives my curiosity for the world of development and implementation of solutions with current tools.
